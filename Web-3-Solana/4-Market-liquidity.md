How easily you can buy or sell an asset without significantly affecting its price.

## High Liquidity

An asset has high liquidity if:

- Many buyers and sellers exist
- You can sell quickly
- Price does not change much when you trade

Example:
If you sell $10,000 worth of an asset and the price barely moves → high liquidity.

---

## Low Liquidity

An asset has low liquidity if:

- Few buyers and sellers exist
- Harder to sell quickly
- Price moves significantly when someone trades

Example:
If you sell $10,000 worth and the price drops sharply → low liquidity.

## Simple Real-Life Analogy

Water:
- Water = highly liquid (flows easily)

- Sand = low liquidity (harder to move smoothly)

In markets:
- More participants = more liquidity
- More liquidity = more stable prices
