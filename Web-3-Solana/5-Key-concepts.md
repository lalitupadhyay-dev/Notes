# Key Concepts

## SOL
Solana's native currency, used to pay transaction fees and participate in network security. Think of it like stamps for sending mail - you need a small amount to use the network. Less than $1 worth of SOL covers hundreds of transactions.

## Wallets
Software that stores your digital assets and lets you interact with applications. Your wallet is like a universal account that works across all Solana applications. One wallet gives you access to thousands of applications, with your assets and history traveling with you.

## Tokens
Digital assets that can represent anything from currencies to ownership stakes in projects. Like apps on your phone, thousands of different tokens exist on Solana. Some maintain stable values for payments, others represent shares in projects or access to services.

## Validators
Computers that process transactions and secure the network. Over 1,000 validators worldwide ensure Solana stays decentralized and reliable. Run by independent operators globally, this distributed structure prevents any single point of failure or control.

## Smart Contracts
Programs that run on Solana, powering everything from simple transfers to complex applications. They execute exactly as programmed without possibility of downtime or interference. Like vending machines for digital services - predictable, automated, and available 24/7.
